{"name":"Kintetsu-style Taiwan Railway Real-time Schedule","tagline":"A Kintetsu-style demonstration of Taiwan Railway schedule with open XML files.","body":"### Introductions.\r\nLaunched on 6/14/2015, this project's main purpose is to demonstrate Taiwan Railway (TRA) real-time schedule, which can be seen in most TRA stations, with much flexibility and better layout. We hope it would become helpful as it can be displayed in visitor centers or stores near TRA stations to remind visitors about their incoming trains.\r\n\r\n![Kintetsu](http://i.imgur.com/qBs09Jh.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe design style itself was inspired from Japanese private railway company: Kintetsu (近鉄). When I visited Nara in 2013, I was amazed by the stylish and smooth design. It is the best PIDS design in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe project is created and maintained by Yi-Hsi Lu (@donkilu).\r\n\r\n### Links.\r\nLink to our present result: [http://donki.byethost7.com/TR.html](http://donki.byethost7.com/TR.html)\r\nIf you want to contact me, feel free to send an email to donkilu@utexas.edu","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
